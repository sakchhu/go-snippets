# Go Snippets (Collection of things I learn about Go and it's usage for different purposes)

### How to run the examples

I assume you have a go compiler installed. Refer [here](https://go.dev/doc/install) for instructions.

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/sakchhu/go-snippets.git`

2. Navigate to the go-snippets directory:

   `cd go-snippets`

3. Execute your desired snippet with:

   `go run . <snippet> [options...]`

   valid `<snippet>` names can be found in [main.go](main.go#L12), specifically the keys in the `funcMap`.


### Exploring examples

All the example code is in the [examples](examples/) directory.
